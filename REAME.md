# Syscall Abstractions

This document outlines the design and implementation of syscall abstractions. The focus is on traits such as `TaskCreation`, `TaskInspection`, and IPC mechanisms. We will discuss the benefits of these abstractions in terms of composability, modularity, and extensibility.

## Task Creation

### Trait Definition

The `TaskCreation` trait is designed for non-static microkernels that support dynamic task creation at runtime. It uses an associated type `Param` to allow each implementation to define its own task configuration structure.

### Purpose

The purpose of the `TaskCreation` trait is to provide a flexible and extensible interface for creating tasks in a microkernel. By using an associated type for task parameters, the trait allows different implementations to define their own task configuration structures, enabling a wide range of use cases.

### Composability

The `TaskCreation` trait supports composability by allowing different implementations to define their own task parameters. This means that the trait can be easily integrated into different microkernel designs, and new task creation mechanisms can be added without modifying the existing trait.

### Modularity

The `TaskCreation` trait promotes modularity by separating the task creation logic from other parts of the microkernel. This makes it easier to develop, test, and maintain the task creation code, and allows different task creation mechanisms to be used interchangeably.

### Extensibility

The `TaskCreation` trait is designed to be extensible, allowing new task creation mechanisms to be added without modifying the existing trait. By using an associated type for task parameters, the trait can accommodate a wide range of task creation configurations, making it suitable for different microkernel designs.
