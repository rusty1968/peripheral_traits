# API Design and Composability

This section outlines the design principles and composability considerations of the system call traits defined for inter-process communication (IPC) and task management in a **multitasking operating system**.

---

## Trait-Based System Call Abstractions

The system call interface is modularized into two primary domains:

- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: Defined by the `IpcSyscalls` trait.
- **Task Management**: Defined by the composite `TaskSyscalls` trait, which includes:
  - `TaskCreation`
  - `TaskTermination`
  - `TaskScheduling`
  - `TaskInspection`

This separation of concerns promotes clean layering, testability, and platform-specific extensibility across a wide range of multitasking OS designs.

## IPC API Design Highlights

### 1. Flexible Message Passing

- `ipc_send`, `ipc_reply`, and `ipc_rcv` provide a complete message lifecycle.
- Use of `impl AsRef<[u8]>` and `impl AsMut<[u8]>` enables zero-copy or borrowed buffer strategies.

### 2. Unified Wait Semantics

- `ipc_rcv` handles both messages and notifications via the `IpcWaitResult` enum.
- Optional timeout and sender filtering support event-driven and real-time use cases.

### 3. Composability

- Associated types (`TargetId`, `IpcFlags`, `ReplyContext`) allow for OS-specific implementations.
- The trait is suitable for integration into higher-level abstractions like RPC, actor models, or message brokers.

---

## Task API Design Highlights

### 1. Modular Composition

- `TaskSyscalls` is a composite trait that unifies four orthogonal capabilities:
  - Creation (`TaskCreation`)
  - Termination (`TaskTermination`)
  - Scheduling (`TaskScheduling`)
  - Inspection (`TaskInspection`)
- This modularity allows for partial implementations in constrained or static environments.

### 2. Associated Types for Extensibility

- `TaskCreation::Param` and `TaskInspection::Info` are left abstract, enabling OS-specific task descriptors and metadata.

### 3. Error Handling Consistency

- All traits inherit from `ErrorType`, ensuring uniform error propagation and simplifying diagnostics.

### 4. Runtime Introspection

- `TaskInspection` supports querying task state, which is essential for debugging, monitoring, and scheduling decisions.

## Composability and Integration

These traits are designed to be:

- **Composable**: Can be implemented independently or together, depending on OS capabilities.
- **Mockable**: Suitable for unit testing and simulation by mocking trait implementations.
- **Extensible**: New traits (e.g., `TaskAffinity`, `IpcPeek`, `TaskSuspend`) can be added without breaking existing code.

---

## Example Use Cases

- **General-purpose OS**: Implements all traits with full runtime task and IPC management.
- **Real-time OS (RTOS)**: May implement only `TaskScheduling` and `TaskTermination`.
- **Test Harness**: Mocks `IpcSyscalls` and `TaskSyscalls` for fuzzing or simulation.
